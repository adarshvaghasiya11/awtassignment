                    A sport is a recreational or competitive activity that involves physical skill. People have enjoyed sports for thousands of years and pursue them for the goals and challenges they entail. Every sport has a set of rules that the players of the sport follow.
                <p>
                    In some sports one person competes against other individuals. Examples of these sports include boxing, wrestling, fencing, gymnastics, archery, and individual swimming and track and field events. In team sports a group of people plays against another group, or team. A team may have as few as two members, or it may have many members. A doubles team in tennis has two players. Five players make up a basketball team. An ice hockey team has six players, and a baseball team has nine. Eleven players make up a gridiron football, soccer, or cricket team.Sports can be amateur or professional. Amateur athletes do not get paid for participating in a sport. Professional athletes, on the other hand, play for money. Sports can also be organized or unorganized. Children who get together for neighborhood football games are playing unorganized sports. No organization controls their games. In organized sports athletes play for a school, a business, a club, a community, or some other organization. The organization schedules games and enforces the rules of the sport.
